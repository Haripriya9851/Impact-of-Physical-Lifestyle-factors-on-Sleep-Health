# Impact-of-Physical-Lifestyle-factors-on-Sleep-Health

Hello! As part of my Introduction to analytics class, I analyzed the Working Groupâ€™s Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle with R programming. This dataset, provides a broad spectrum of variables associated with sleep and daily routines. My key objective is to identify patterns, trends, and insights into the factors influencing sleep health, guiding recommendations for improving sleep quality for working age group population.

## **Dataset Description:**
- **Source of the dataset:** [sleep-health-and-lifestyle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/sleep-health-and-lifestyle)
- This dataset, contains 373 rows and 13 columns, encompasses a broad spectrum of variables associated with sleep and daily routines of the working group people aged between 24 to 59 years.
 - It provides information on aspects like gender, age, profession, duration of sleep, sleep quality, level of physical activity, stress levels, BMI classification, and the existence or non-existence of sleep disorders.

## **Age-Wise Sleep duration:**

**Inference:**

1. Sleep duration increases with age, with the peak in the 50-59 group, reflecting heightened attention to health and well-being near retirement.
2. Younger adults (20-29) sleep the least, and those over 30 generally experience longer sleep might be due to routine lifestyle and increased health focus.

## Impact of Obesity on Sleep Quality:

**Inference:**

1. Obesity disrupts body sleep cycles.
2. Chart shows, Normal BMI category(in Red) population shows better sleep quality than overweight and obese(in Green) BMI category.
 

## Impact of Occupational Stress on Sleep Quality:

**Inference:**

1. There is a negative impact of occupational stress on sleep quality. The chart displays sleep quality(in Green) and average stress(in Red) across different occupations. It is organized from best to worst sleep quality.
2. Based on ordered chart's last row, the Target-oriented jobs (like Sales Representatives and scientists), show higher stress and lower sleep duration.
3. In contrast, the first row of the grid, stable, routine occupations like Engineers and Accountants exhibit lower stress levels and better sleep patterns.

## Recommendations based on analysis:

1. Individuals should focus on maintaining a healthy BMI and managing stress regardless of workload to improve sleep health.
2. Organizations should create a supportive work culture that prioritizes employee well-being and work-life balance.
3. Organizations should implement targeted health and wellness programs that address specific stressors and health issues associated with different occupations to enhance sleep  and overall health quality .
